## API decision docs

### use webc components

- why? 
  - i need to practice using them
  - they're a web standard
  - 11ty's webc aligns my goal with that standard in an extremely performant and convenient way

### frontmatter should be used to control page metadata

not to render contents (as possible; willing to revisit based on dx feedback). Using Markdown, plain html + css, or adding a new webc component would probably be best.
